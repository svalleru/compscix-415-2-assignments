# Data Views

### Viewing your data

Up until now we've seen at least three ways to view your data:

- `View()`: shows a table in the Source pane
- `glimpse()`: shows variables, types, and a few values
- `head()`: shows the first `n` rows or entries
- `tail()`: shows the last `n` rows or entries

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
glimpse(diamonds)
```

---
### Viewing your data

To see just the column names:


```{r}
names(diamonds)
```

---
### Viewing your data

To see the object **type**:

```{r}
class(diamonds)
```

OK, so what does `tbl_df`, `tbl` and `data.frame` even mean?

# Data Wrangling
---
### `dplyr` package

Once again we will use the amazing `tidyverse` set of packages to do our data wrangling. Specifically, we will be using `dplyr`.

- All functions we look at today work like this:

  + take a `data.frame` (or `tibble`) as the first argument
  
  + subsequent arguments describe what to do and uses unquoted variable names
  
  + return a new `data.frame` (or `tibble`) object
  
```{r, eval=FALSE}
function_name(data.frame, what to do and with which variables)
```

---
### Tibbles? Data frames?

- A `tibble` is a `data.frame`, but with some special characteristics that we'll learn about later

  + Recall that a `data.frame` is like a table with rows of observations and columns of variables (can be of different *types*) 
  
  + We've been using data frames and tibbles as our data sets for ggplot all along

---
### `dplyr` functions and the `%>%` pipe

- Since each function takes and returns the same type of object, they are perfect functions for chaining

  + Recall the pipe operator: `%>%`
  
  + The pipe works left-to-right by plugging in the output of what's on the left as the first argument of what's on the right
  
  `function_1 %>% function_2 %>% function_3 %>% ...` 
  
  is read 
  
  `function_1 then function_2 then function_3 then ...`
  
---
### `dplyr` functions and the `%>%` pipe

Suppose we have a group of nested functions where we want to:

- filter the data
- select a column
- and then take the average of that column

```{r, eval = FALSE}
mean(select(filter(data_name, filter_condition), column_name))
```

OR, using the pipe:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
data_name %>% filter(filter_condition) %>% select(column_name) %>% mean()
```
---
### Grammar for data wrangling

There are five verbs for working with data in a data frame:

- `select()` - take a subset of columns

- `filter()` - take a subset of rows

- `mutate()` - add or modify existing columns

- `arrange()` - sort the rows

- `summarize()` - aggregate the data across rows (by groups)

---
### Grammar for data wrangling

There are five verbs for working with data in a data frame:

- **`select()` - take a subset of columns**

- `filter()` - take a subset of rows

- `mutate()` - add or modify existing columns

- `arrange()` - sort the rows

- `summarize()` - aggregate the data across rows (by groups)

---
### The `flights` data
```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(nycflights13)
library(tidyverse)
```
```{r, echo=FALSE}
glimpse(flights)
```
---
### The `select()` verb

```{r}
select(flights, year, month, day)
```

---
### The `select()` verb

```{r}
select(flights, year:day)
```
---
### The `select()` verb

```{r}
select(flights, -(year:day))
```
---
### The `select()` verb - helper functions

```{r}
select(flights, starts_with('d'))
```
---
### The `select()` verb - helper functions

There are many more helper functions. Your task: figure out what all of these do.

- `ends_with()`

- `contains()`

- `matches()`

- `num_range()`

- `everything()`

- `select()` - take a subset of columns

- **`filter()` - take a subset of rows**

- `mutate()` - add or modify existing columns

- `arrange()` - sort the rows

- `summarize()` - aggregate the data across rows (by groups)

---
### The `filter()` verb

```{r}
filter(flights, month == 1, day == 1)
```

---
### The `filter()` verb

Comparisons:

- Less than: `<`

- Greather than: `>`

- Less than or equal to: `<=`

- Greater than or equal to: `>=`

- Not equal to: `!=`

- Equal to: `==`

- Equal to (for continuous numbers): `near()`
---
### The `filter()` verb

Logicals:

- And: `&`

- Or: `|`

- Not: `!`

---
### The `filter()` verb

```{r}
filter(flights, month == 11 | month == 12)
```
---
### The `filter()` verb

```{r}
filter(flights, month %in% c(11, 12))
```

---
### Pop Quiz

Without writing code, how would we find all flights in the `flights` data in January, Febuary, and April that departed before 6:00AM or after 6:00PM and had arrival delay of more than 60 minutes? Note that departure times are given as integers (e.g. 6:00PM = 1800) 

```{r, echo = FALSE}
# (month = 1 OR month = 2 OR month = 4) AND (dep_time < 600 OR dep_time > 1800) AND arr_delay > 60
# month %in% (1, 2, 4) & (dep_time < 600 | dep_time > 1800) & arr_delay > 60
```
---
### The `filter()` verb

Missing values in R are denoted as `NA` (not available). To filter out, or check for missing values, we use `is.na()`.

```{r}
x <- NA
x == NA
is.na(x)
```

---
### Grammar for data wrangling

There are five verbs for working with data in a data frame:

- `select()` - take a subset of columns

- `filter()` - take a subset of rows

- **`mutate()` - add or modify existing columns**

- `arrange()` - sort the rows

- `summarize()` - aggregate the data across rows (by groups)

---
### The `mutate()` verb

Let's first create a narrower data set:

```{r}
flights_sml <- select(flights, 
  year:day, 
  ends_with("delay"), 
  distance, 
  air_time
)
```
---
### The `mutate()` verb

```{r}
mutate(flights_sml,
  gain = arr_delay - dep_delay,
  speed = distance / air_time * 60
)
```
---
### The `mutate()` verb

```{r}
transmute(flights_sml,
  gain = arr_delay - dep_delay,
  hours = air_time / 60,
  gain_per_hour = gain / hours
)
```

- **`arrange()` - sort the rows**

- `summarize()` - aggregate the data across rows (by groups)

---
### The `arrange()` verb

```{r}
arrange(flights, month, day, dep_time)
```
---
### The `arrange()` verb

```{r}
arrange(flights, desc(month), day, desc(dep_time))
```

---

- `select()` - take a subset of columns

- `mutate()` - add or modify existing columns

- `arrange()` - sort the rows

- **`summarize()` - aggregate the data across rows (by groups)**

---
### The `summarize()` verb

`summarize()` only makes sense if you *group by* a variable

```{r}
summarize(flights, delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE))
```
---
### The `summarize()` verb

`summarize()` only makes sense if you *group by* a variable

```{r}
by_dest <- group_by(flights, dest)
summarise(by_dest,
  count = n(),
  dist = mean(distance, na.rm = TRUE),
  delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE)
)
```
---
### The `summarize()` verb and the pipe

```{r}
flights %>% 
  group_by(dest) %>% 
  summarise(
    count = n(),
    dist = mean(distance, na.rm = TRUE),
    delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE)
  )
```
---
### The `summarize()` verb

We'll talk more about `summarize` next week when we start getting into statistics.
