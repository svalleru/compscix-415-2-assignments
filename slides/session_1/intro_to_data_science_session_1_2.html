# What is Data Science?

---
### What is data science?

Data science entails:

### *Data Exploration and Statistical Inference* 

- exploring data for insights

  + visualizations, data summaries

- explaining what happened and describing properties of data

  + hypothesis tests, statistical models 

### *Predictive Modeling*

- predicting what will happen and why

  + machine learning and statistical models

### What is a data scientist?

I want to hear what you think.

### What is a data scientist?

I want to hear what you think. 

--

Do we have to limit the definition to exclude:

--

Data analysts?

--

Statisticians?

--

Business Intelligence Analysts?

--

Data engineers?

---
### What is a data scientist?

In general a data scientist:

--

- is a problem solver

--

- is a decent coder

--

- is proficient in math and stats

--

- is a good communicator

--

- is a curious person

---
### What is a data scientist?

In general a data scientist:

--

- can come from many backgrounds
  + technical and non-technical
  + I've worked with people who were in Physics, Bioinformatics, Mechanical Engineering, Mathematics, Computer Science
  + Some have PhD's, some have MA/MS's, and some have BA/BS's

--

- might use R, might prefer Python, might not care

--

- is excited about learning from data

---

### Data Science: the two paradigms

### For Machines

- Only thing that matters is predictive accuracy

- Model can be complex, black box, and filled with uninterpretable features

- Examples: Amazon &amp; Netflix recommendations; FB news feed; Google translate

### For Humans

- What matters more is that humans can take action on the results

- Model needs to be interpretable enough to know what to do with it

- Examples: nearly everything I've worked on
