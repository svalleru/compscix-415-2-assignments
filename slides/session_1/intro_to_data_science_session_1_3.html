# The Data Science Lifecycle

---
.pull-left[
### In a perfect world, data science projects would look like this:

1. You have a brilliant idea to solve an important problem!

2. You easily find perfectly clean data to help you solve it, in a tabular format.

3. You spend most of your time analysing and fine tuning your favorite models until it's perfect.

4. Your company takes your results and saves millions of dollars!!

5. Everybody thinks you're a rockstar.

### In the real world, they look like this:

1. Somebody you don't know has a vague idea of a problem.

2. You spend 3 months hunting down and cleaning data.

3. You spend 1-2 weeks tuning models to rush out your results.

4. Your company praises your work and either:
  + It is swiftly forgotten
  + It gets deployed but company struggles to act on it

5. Only your boss and teammates know who you are.

### Lifecycle

- Business Understanding and Problem Formulation
  + Work with the business to define the problem
  + Identify the data that can solve the problem
  + Assign roles

--

- Data Collection, Data Understanding
  + Find the data and collect
  + Find SME's 
  + Data understanding and cleaning

--

- Exploratory Data Analysis, Visualization
  + Explore, clean and visualize data

--

- Model Training/Analytics
  + Create features and labels/target/event
  + Create final data sets (train/test/validation)
  + Find insights/train models

 
---
### Lifecycle

- Deployment
  + Real-time or batch
  + Dashboard or API

--

- User Acceptance
  + Business takes results and acts on them

--

- Value and Impact Analysis
  + Periodically assess model's impact
  + Fingers crossed for big $$$ 

--

- Model Performance Tracking
  + Track model over time

--

- Model Retraining and Redeployment
  + When model deteriorates, retrain and deploy

# Best Practices

---
### Data science best practices

1. Stay organized:
  + project timelines;
  + roles;
  + files and folder structure. I like [Microsoft's](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-TDSP-ProjectTemplate).

--
  
2. Document your work: 
  + your code; 
  + your analyses.

--

3. Keep track of your code:
  + version control.

--

4. Make your work reproducible:
  + code;
  + data;
  + documentation.

2. Document your work: 
  + your code; **comment your code**
  + your analyses. **RStudio notebooks/R Markdown**

3. Keep track of your code:
  + version control. **git and Github**

4. Make your work reproducible: **RStudio notebooks/R Markdown**
  + code;
  + data;
  + documentation.

---
### Data science best practices

5. Keep yourself honest
  + Tempting to only report *good* results
  + Tempting to *tweak* results to match expectations
  + Difficult to tell the boss "no"

--

6. Think about User Experience
  + Make smart and *pretty* visuals
  + Make easy-to-read visuals
  + Make easy-to-use apps

--

7. Communication
  + Tell a story with your analysis
  + Words: use more in your technical documents; use less in your slides
  + Most people aren't technical, don't try to sound smart

--
  
8. KISS it
  + Not everything needs a deep learning model
