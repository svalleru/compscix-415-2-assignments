# Introduction to Data Science
## Session 5.1
### Robert Clements

---




### Housekeeping

- Questions on Homework 4?
- Questions about the Midterm?
- Homework 3 solutions are up
- Midterm will be released by tonight after 9:30PM
  + Midterm is due next Tuesday by 6:15PM
  + Remember, no working together on the midterm
  + Late midterms will get a **zero** grade
  + We will review the midterm in class during Week 7

---
### Session 5.1 Outline

- A little more motivation
- Professional Ethics
  + *Modern Data Science with R - Chapter 6*
---
class: inverse, center, middle
## A little more motivation for learning R:
### [This article on climate change](https://www.kron4.com/news/bay-area/what-will-weather-be-like-in-san-francisco-in-60-years-more-like-los-angeles-study-says/1797903052) along with [this Shiny web application](https://fitzlab.shinyapps.io/cityapp/).

# Professional Ethics
---
class: inverse, center, middle
# Question: Do we need a Hippocratic Oath for data scientists? Why or why not?
---
### The Oath

- I will not be ashamed to say 'I know not', nor will I fail to call in my colleagues when the skills of another are needed

- I will respect the privacy of my patients

- I will remember that I remain a member of society, with special obligations to all my fellow human beings

# Is there anything ethically wrong about the following charts?

### Convention

In data graphics, *up* corresponds to increasing values. We are taught this from the first time we draw cartesian coordinates.

---
### Convention

We also expect the scale of our axes to provide the context we need to interpret the data correctly.

### Playing God

There are stories in the text, but here's a personal anecdote.

*I once had a project to develop models that could predict when a specific part of a jet engine would fail to the point of being irreparable. The results of the model could potentially allow the company to book a certain amount of future savings ($). The data was sparse, and highly variable, and I couldn't get a robust model out of it - I showed the managers that even slight changes in the data lead to a wildly different model. The managers were under such intense pressure to find millions in savings that they took the model's best results, and ignored the bad results.*

### Reproducibility

I harp on this all of the time, and this article is one reason why.

[Growth in a Time of Debt](http://www.nber.org/papers/w15639) - Ken Rogoff and Carmen Reinhart. 

This is an article that argued that austerity policies don't lead to slow economic growth.

Thomas Herndon, Michael Ash and Robert Pollin were able to get the original Excel file from the authors to try to reproduce their analysis. In a critique published in the Cambridge Journal of Economics they concluded that they found:

- coding errors
- selective exclusion of data
- unconventional weighting of summary statistics

More critiques were later released.

### Consent

- In 2016, [OpenPsych published a large data set](https://www.wired.com/2016/05/okcupid-study-reveals-perils-big-data-science/) of users of the OKCupid dating site for psychological research. They did not anonymize the data, saying instead "the data is already public".

---
### Consent

- In 2012, Facebook [performed a week long experiment](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2014/06/28/facebook-manipulated-689003-users-emotions-for-science/#52f4237e197c) on its users. The goal was to manipulate users' news feeds to see if it affects their mood.

### Consent

- In 2018, it was revealed that Facebook data for 87 million users' information was obtained by Cambridge Analytica.

### Data and disclosure, safe data storage, terms of use, and reproducibility


- **Disclosure avoidance** 
  + The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) regulates how Protected Health Information (PHI) is shared. 
- **Data storage** 
  + Safe data storage is critical (tons of examples of protected data being stolen)
- **Terms of Use**
  + Often explicitly details what data, how often, and how it can be used
- **Reproducible analysis** - 
  + Data - all original data retained
  + Metadata - codebooks and data dictionaries
  + Commands - actual code
  + Map - a file that maps between output and results in the report
