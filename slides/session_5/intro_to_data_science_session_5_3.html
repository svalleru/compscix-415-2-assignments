### Covariation and Correlation

Covariation is the tendency for the values of two or more variables to vary together in a related way.

There are three scenarios to deal with:

1. **One categorical and one continuous variable**

2. Two categorical variables

3. Two continuous variables.

---
### Visualizing covariation

Scenario 1: use boxplots.

What is a surprising finding from this plot?


```r
library(tidyverse)

ggplot(data = diamonds, mapping = aes(x = cut, y = price)) + 
  geom_boxplot()
```

&lt;img src="intro_to_data_science_session_5_3_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
---
### Visualizing covariation

Scenario 1: use boxplots.

Sometimes R doesn't know in advance that our categorical variable is ordinal. Or, sometimes you simply want to reorder a variable for visual reasons.


```r
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = class, y = hwy)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

&lt;img src="intro_to_data_science_session_5_3_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
---
### Visualizing covariation

Scenario 1: use boxplots.

Sometimes R doesn't know in advance that our categorical variable is ordinal. Or, sometimes you simply want to reorder a variable for visual reasons. Let's reorder `class` by the median of `hwy`.


```r
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_boxplot(mapping = aes(x = reorder(class, hwy, FUN = median), y = hwy))
```

&lt;img src="intro_to_data_science_session_5_3_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
---
### Pop Quiz

Sometimes category names are large and so it would make sense to plot boxplots on the y-axis. Reproduce this plot from the `diamonds` data set:

&lt;img src="intro_to_data_science_session_5_3_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
---
### Covariation and Correlation

Covariation is the tendency for the values of two or more variables to vary together in a related way.

There are three scenarios to deal with:

1. One categorical and one continuous variable

2. **Two categorical variables**

3. Two continuous variables.

---
### Visualizing covariation

Scenario 2: use a heatmap (not a mosaic) with added text using `geom_tile()` and `geom_text()`.

What do we notice about the color and cut of diamonds?


```r
diamonds %&gt;% 
  count(color, cut) %&gt;% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = color, y = cut)) +
  geom_tile(mapping = aes(fill = n)) +
  geom_text(aes(label = n), color = 'white')
```

&lt;img src="intro_to_data_science_session_5_3_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
---
### Covariation and Correlation

Covariation is the tendency for the values of two or more variables to vary together in a related way.

There are three scenarios to deal with:

1. One categorical and one continuous variable

2. Two categorical variables

3. **Two continuous variables**.

---
### Visualizing covariation

Scenario 3: use scatterplots.

What is wrong with this plot? What are some suggestions for fixing it?


```r
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price))
```

&lt;img src="intro_to_data_science_session_5_3_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
---
### Visualizing covariation with larger data sets

Scenario 3: use 2-d binning with the `geom_bin2d()` geom.


```r
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_bin2d(mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price))
```

&lt;img src="intro_to_data_science_session_5_3_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
---
### Patterns and models

Patterns reveal possible relationships. Ask yourself these questions when you spot a pattern:

1. Is the pattern due to random chance?

2. What does the relationship look like? Is it positive, negative, up down? Describe it.

3. How strong is the relationship? Weak? Strong? So-so?

4. Are there other variables that might affect this relationship?

5. Does the relationship change if you look at subgroups of the data?
---
### The importance of patterns

Patterns reveal covariation (or correlation). Although *variance* is a measure of uncertainty and spread, *covariance* can actually help **reduce** uncertainty. If two (or more) variables have high covariance, you can use the values of one (or more) to predict, or explain, the values of another.

In rare cases of causal relationships, you can use the value of a variable to **control** the value of another.

We can use *models* to help us extract patterns out of data.
---
### Patterns and models

Look at the pattern in this histogram of eruption times of Old Faithful in Yellowstone National Park.

Why does this pattern exist? Is it random? Is it a strong pattern?


```r
ggplot(data = faithful, aes(x = eruptions)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  xlab('Eruption time in minutes')
```

&lt;img src="intro_to_data_science_session_5_3_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
---
### Pop Quiz

This is a histogram of the eruption times (in minutes) of the Old Faithful geyser in Yellowstone National Park. What might explain this shape?

&lt;img src="intro_to_data_science_session_5_3_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
---
### Pop Quiz

Look at the `faithful` data set and ask yourself: is there a variable that might affect the pattern seen below? If so, make a plot that reveals the reason for the pattern seen in this histogram. What is the reason?

&lt;img src="intro_to_data_science_session_5_3_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
---
### Your first taste of a model

Remember this counterintuitive graphic?

How can we explain this result?


```r
ggplot(data = diamonds, mapping = aes(x = cut, y = price)) + 
  geom_boxplot()
```

&lt;img src="intro_to_data_science_session_5_3_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
---
### Your first taste of a model

The pattern between carat and price is strong, positive, and explainable. Let's go back to our list of questions.


```r
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_bin2d(mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price))
```

&lt;img src="intro_to_data_science_session_5_3_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
---
### Your first taste of a model

1. Is the pattern due to random chance?
2. What does the relationship look like? Is it positive, negative, up, down? Describe it.
3. How strong is the relationship? Weak? Strong? So-so?
4. Are there other variables that might affect this relationship? **ding! ding! ding!**
5. Does the relationship change if you look at subgroups of the data?


```r
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_bin2d(mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price))
```

&lt;img src="intro_to_data_science_session_5_3_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
---
### Thought experiment

How might we reveal a more intuitive pattern between the price and cut of diamonds by considering the very complex relationships between price, carat, and cut?
